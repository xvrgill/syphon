# Syphon

A machine learning and artificial intelligence package that optimizes well 
known estimators for specific industry use cases with the goal of creating a 
comprehensive set of estimators that avoid generalized solutions of popular 
solutions.

## Supported Industries

The objective is to start with financial services and branch out to other fields. 
Some ideas of the industries that could benefit from suport within `Syphon` include 
but are certainly not limited to:

- Insurance
- Asset Management
- Aerospace & Defense
- Automotive
- Retail & Sales
- Medicine

Priority should be given to industries that are "formulaic" in their approach to data. 
This means that there is typically a standard way to do things. For example, predicting 
rate of return at an investment firm or customer churn in sales is common practice and 
is leveraged often.

This concept is largely limited by the domain knowledge of our unique contributors, therefore 
no industries will be black listed.

## Supported Solutions

1. Common equations and algorithms
2. Domain specific machine learning estimators
3. Tailor-made artificial intelligence solutions

## Guidelines

- Must be operating system agnostic
- Must have a Python API
- Supported languages:
  - Pure python
  - Cython
  - C
  - C++
  - Assembly
  - Java
